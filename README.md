In this project, I've implemented the classic Connect4 game, focusing on creating an interactive and enjoyable experience. The game features:

ðŸ”¹ Two game modes:

AI mode using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for a challenging single-player experience.
Two-player mode for playing against a friend.
ðŸ”¹ A user-friendly interface created with pygame
ðŸ”¹ Efficient game logic for a smooth gameplay experience

Libraries used:

numpy
pygame
os
sys
math
random

This project helped me further hone my skills in Python programming, especially in areas like algorithm design and user interaction.
